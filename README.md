# NEAT - Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies

Despite of rapidly developing of new machine learning algorithms such as reinforement learning in solving unsupervised problem, the very old techique - NEAT was very successful in training an agent that can play Flappy Bird incredibly. 

You can find the config for NEAT network in the **config** text file.

Deeply thanks to the tutorial series called **Python Flappy Bird AI Tutorial (with NEAT)** on Youtube from [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxFDaIOHsE&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2). 

The tutorial is very helpful and detailed about the implementation of NEAT and Flappy Bird in Python.
